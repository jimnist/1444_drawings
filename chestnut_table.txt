I am interested in some of your Antique Wormy Chestnut beams for a table I am building. below are the quantities and dimensions of the beams you have listed on your site.

I'm not sure how long the beams you have are, so i am listing  quantities of the lengths that I need.

2"x10" - I need 4 lengths of 5 feet each
2"x8" - I need 3 lengths of 3 feet each


(could use 5 of the 2x8s)


overdrill holes & use washers on braces
